# Leaf-Spring-Reliability-FEA
It includes the implementation of the probabilistic methods to analyze the effects of leaf parameters such as it's thickness, width, and span and the load application on the bending stress in the spring. All these parameters are random. The objective is to reduce the 
overall stress in the spring with optimized leaf dimensions. 

- Analyzed the effect of the span, width, and thickness of the leaf, with the varying load, on the bending stress;
- Performed chi-square test to determine the probability distribution of input parameters; generated MATLAB codes for FORM and MCS; sensitivity analysis 
- Calculated optimized values of variables with a safety factor of 2; a difference of 6.92 % in the reliability index from FORM and MCS
