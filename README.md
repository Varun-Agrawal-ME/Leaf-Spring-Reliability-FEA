# Leaf-Spring-Reliability-FEA
This research work includes the static analysis of a leaf spring using probabilistic method and finite element analysis.
It includes the implementation of the probabilistic methods to analyze the 
effects of parameters such as the thickness of the leaf, material variation, effective length, and the 
number of leaves, on stiffness, stress, and deflection in the spring. All these parameters are random. The objective is to reduce the 
overall stress in the spring with minimal deflection.
